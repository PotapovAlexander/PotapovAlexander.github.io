<p>&nbsp;Three figures waited behind a simple table. Their attention on a single chair, bathed in light. An old woman's voice from the shadow: 'Send her in'. Across the room a security officer, stern and plain, opened the door. The outline of a young woman appeared at the door. She hesitated, but only for an instant, then crossed the room and sat.
There was a gasp as the light hit her face. Her right eye was bright and blinking, but her left was a greasy slit. Her skin had been burned moon-white. Her mouth was a sagging gash without lips or expression. Her military beret was pulled snug over a scarred and hairless scalp.</p>

<p>&nbsp;'And that is when you violated procedure?'</p>
<p>&nbsp;Kaleen bowed her head, a tear welling in her sightless eye. 'They were children. They were afraid. They needed comfort.'</p>
